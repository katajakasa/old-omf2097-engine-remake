Tons of information about the game file formats was taken from here:
http://wtf.hijacked.us:8080/wiki/index.php/OMF2097_File_Formats

Some filtershaders are from bsnes (http://byuu.org/bsnes/) by byuu.

Also thanks to Teistiz, who didn't beat me to tiny bits 
when i bombarded him with tons of OpenGL related questions :P
